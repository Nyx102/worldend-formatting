The ellipsis … has a space after it where it would start a new sentence, and doesn't otherwise. 

Rules:
- If it starts the line or starts the quote, or already has a space before it, it doesn't have a space after it. 
- If it is followed by a lowercase letter, it doesn't have a space after it.
- If it is  before a capital letter, it usually has a space after it, but not if it's before something that would be capitalized anyway like someone's name or the word "I".

Formatting:

(…)|(\.\.\.) => #…

Shouldn't have space:
([\r\n\s"'“”‘’….(?!]>)#…[ ]? => $1…
#…[ ]?([a-z”’….)\r\n?!<]) => …$1
