**Note:** Still very much a work-in-progress.

# Prerequisites
You should have the following:

1. Python packages listed in `Scripts/requirements.txt`
2. `xelatex` in  your PATH
    * If your TeX distribution does not support automatically installing missing packages, you'll also need to install all the necesarry TeX packages to compile `Common/TeX/WorldEnd2_Common.tex`

# Usage
Once you have completed all the prerequisites, you can run `Scripts/output_tex.py`:

```sh
python ./Scripts/output_tex.py "./Volumes/Volume 3" "./Output"
```
